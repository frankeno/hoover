# Hoover
Nice collection of CSS transitions to spice up your web design

## Download/Install

```css 
<link href="css/hoover.css" rel="stylesheet">
``` 


## How To Use
1. In the `hoover.css` file, find the CSS property you'd like to apply to your div, button, text, etc.

#### You can customize the `hover.css` file as you wish, such as shadow or border colors, transitions duration, and so on. It's open source, it's yours ;)
